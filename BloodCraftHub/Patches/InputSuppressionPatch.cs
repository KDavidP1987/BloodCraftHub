// 0.16: suppress the local character's GAMEPLAY input (movement / aim /
// ability + hotkey casts) while the BCH main panel is open, so the character
// doesn't act in the background while the user clicks buttons or types into
// forms. Chief friend-test complaint — especially bad for admins who fire
// hotkeyed abilities by accident.
//
// APPROACH HISTORY (see docs/LESSONS_LEARNED.md + memory):
//   - 0.1.x: PREFIX on InputActionSystem.OnUpdate returning false → FROZE the
//     whole game. CAUSE: InputActionSystem ALSO drives Unity UI input, so
//     skipping it starved the UI. Removed.
//   - 0.16 #1: POSTFIX on InputActionSystem zeroing EntityInput.Movement/.State.
//     Safe but INEFFECTIVE — the write persisted on read-back yet the character
//     still moved. CAUSE (found this session): GameplayInputSystem runs AFTER
//     InputActionSystem and re-populates EntityInput from live hardware,
//     overwriting our zero the same frame.
//   - 0.16 #2: adding ProjectM.UI.ChatInputFocused tag to LocalCharacter — no
//     effect; the engine's chat-focus gate isn't keyed off the character entity.
//   - 0.16 #3 (THIS): skip the actual CLIENT GAMEPLAY PRODUCER systems while the
//     panel is open:
//        * ProjectM.GameplayInputSystem.OnUpdate  -> movement + aim
//        * ProjectM.AbilityInputSystem.OnUpdate   -> ability / hotkey casts
//     These are SEPARATE systems from InputActionSystem, which keeps running —
//     so Unity UI input, the cursor, and BCH form typing all stay alive
//     (structurally NO freeze, unlike 0.1.x). The character stops moving,
//     aiming, and casting. We also zero EntityInput once while blocking so a key
//     held at open-time doesn't drift — and this time the zero STICKS, because
//     the system that used to overwrite it (GameplayInputSystem) is skipped.
//
// Gated behind Settings.SuppressGameInputWhileUIOpen (kill-switch, default OFF).
// Every callback is wrapped so any exception falls through to running the
// original system — a bug in here can NEVER freeze the game.
