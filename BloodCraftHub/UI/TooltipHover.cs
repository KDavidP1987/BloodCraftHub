// Static hover-tooltip service. Each attached binding is a (RectTransform, string)
// pair. While the MainPanel is open, TickAll checks the mouse position against each
// rect; the first match writes its tooltip text into the shared Sink (a
// TextMeshProUGUI at the bottom of the MainPanel).
//
// Why not use IPointerEnterHandler/IPointerExitHandler on a subclassed
// MonoBehaviour: under Il2CppInterop those interfaces are exposed as wrapped
// classes, not interfaces, so a managed class can't implement them - the C#
// compiler reports CS1721 "multiple base classes". Polling avoids the issue.
//
// 0.18 PERF: this was written for "~30 tooltips" but the UI grew to THOUSANDS of
// bindings (4000+ in a full session). Ticking every frame iterated all of them with
// per-element IL2CPP interop (activeInHierarchy + GetComponentInParent<Canvas>) — a
// large always-on main-thread cost even with the panel CLOSED, felt worst on a
// self-hosted server where the client shares the CPU with the server process. Three
// fixes: (1) the Sink only renders inside the MainPanel, so skip the whole scan when
// the panel is closed; (2) cache each binding's canvas camera (it never changes)
// instead of walking the hierarchy every frame; (3) stop at the first hit.
